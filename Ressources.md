# Google docs

I had forgotten about this document, and therefore not updated it for a long time.

Currently, I would like to add the future resources into this document instead.
That way, resources are tied to the repository, and not to a Google account.

This document will serve as a more personal document, storing resources that i might need later.
Not necessarily, something that will be useful for others to understand the project.
